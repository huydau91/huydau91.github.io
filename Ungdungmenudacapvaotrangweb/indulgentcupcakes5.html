		<p>MOM’S FAVORITE CARROT CAKE CUPCAKES</p>
		<div class="desc">Every year for our birthdays when I was growing up we’d get to pick what cake we wanted to eat. My mom always went back and forth between strawberry shortcake and carrot cake. The strawberry shortcake was fine and all, but it was the carrot cake that I really loved. I don’t know what it was about that one, but between the spices and the nuts, the sweetness with that slightly savory flavor from the carrots, it was truly one of my favorite cakes. Not that I’d have swapped out the brownies I chose for my own birthday, but even now it’s still one of my go-to happy cakes. These <strong>Carrot Cake Cupcakes</strong> are fantastic because not only do they give you all the delicious goodness of traditional carrot cake, but they also pack in the “proposed” portion control…like that’s stopped any of us amiright?? Regardless, definitely a favorite around my house. Enjoy!</div>
