		<p>SWEET LITTLE LEMONADE STAND CUPCAKES</p>
		<div class="desc">I always wanted to have a lemonade stand when I was a kid, but we never really lived anywhere where it would be practical. I mean, we moved all the time and my parents loved having a little land to our name, so literally the only people I could have ever sold my lemonade to would have been my parents and my brothers. No bueno. Plus, the truth is, they’re all very cheap. Even if I’d sold my lemonade at a reasonable price of $0.25 per glass, I’m sure they’d have tried to haggle me down. And who has enough pennies for that? Not me, that’s for sure. So since I’m no longer little, I came up with these <strong>Lemonade Stand Cupcakes</strong> instead. These are WAY better than the real thing because they have a secret, gooey middle. That’s right. You’ll never find a gooey center at a real lemonade stand…or if you do, you should probably ask what that sucker’s made out of because that doesn’t sound very appetizing. My centers, though? You’re going to FLIP! Enjoy!</div>
